      <p>
        This project is an assignment for the IISC Bangalore Summer Internship.
        The website utilizes YOLOv5s, a state-of-the-art object detection
        system, to detect, annotate, and count vehicles in traffic. This
        technology can be instrumental in managing and analyzing traffic flow,
        potentially contributing to smarter and more efficient transportation
        systems.
